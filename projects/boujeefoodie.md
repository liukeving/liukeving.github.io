This project, Boujee Foodie, is dedicated to assisting the University of Hawaii at Manoa students, faculty, and visitors by having a responsive web application to search the restaurants on campus and see the reviews for each restaurant. It allows users to login and search the available restaurants on campus, having a restaurant page for each vendor that dives into more information and user reviews. The most recent deployment via Galaxy Meteor can be found at [Boujee Foodie](https://boujeefoodie.meteorapp.com). 

For this project working with a team of four individuals, I helped with various aspects of the project in order to complete it by the given deadline. For the first deadline, I created the List Restaurant Page where all the restaurants on campus would be listed and deployed the website onto Meteor. For the second deadline, I created the Add Restaurant page and updated the Footer based on our instructor's feedback. Lastly, I assisted updating the Sticky Footer and cleaned the code to fit the ESLint coding style.

This project served as a large stepping stone, being a great foundation for implementing the knowledge that we have learned within ICS 314: Software Engineering. A large aspect of this project was learning how to work together as a group effectively and efficiently, utilizing GitHub as the medium of sharing code amongst ourselves. In addition, we were able to gain a lot of experience as we needed to solve problems after problems with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React. However, despite the many trials and tribulations we encountered, we persevered and completed the project by the deadline.
