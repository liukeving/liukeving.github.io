# Refreshing Javascript
Having a very basic knowledge of Javascript from my dashboard project in Smart Campus Energy Lab in the fall semester of 2018 (look in projects folder for more information), this Javascript 1 module was pretty simple, serving as a great opportunity to review coding in Javascript. From what I have learned thus far, Javascript supercedes all the coding languages I know by simplifying the syntax. For example, you do not need to initialize the types of the variables, allowing the simulator to figure out by itself. In a software engineering perspective, Javascript serves as a great tool that allows users to simply understand what is happening within the code. However, with that hidden feature, it may be harder to know what is being passed within the code since the variables are not explicitly defined. Sometimes as an engineer, you would need to understand the program behind the code in order to code efficiently and successfully. Nonetheless, Javascript is an essential tool for engineers to know, being one of the basics coding languages to practice and master! 

# Quenching Thirst of an Athlete
This was my first experience with athletic software engineering where we were always on the grind. Honestly, it has been quite tiring looking over all the readings and assignments that were due almost every single day throughout the week; however, it is a great methodology of learning since we are constantly exposed to the material day by day. Though I understand the meaning behind implementing this teaching, it is still a hassle to always have these assignments to complete every single day alongside my other responsibilities and duties. Therefore, it also provides the benefit of learning how to time-manage my academics, my extracurricular organizations, and my job. Despite my initial disgust in this routine, over time when I become accustomed to it, I believe that it would be a fun, exciting challenge to stay on top of my tasks.
