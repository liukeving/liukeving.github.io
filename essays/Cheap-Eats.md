# Overview
## Problem:
College students are typically low on cash due to tuition and being a college student. When you want to eat out and are on a budget you would want the best deal around. However, if you haven’t been around the island a lot, you probably don’t know where the best cheap eats are. 
## Solution:
This website would list the best cheap eats on the island for college students to go. Various restaurants would be listed from the search bar. Depending on the user selection, the restaurant page would be shown.
